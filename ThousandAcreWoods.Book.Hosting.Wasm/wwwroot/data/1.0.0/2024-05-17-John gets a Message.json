      "Text": "The young man had been sitting still in front of his computer for about 10 minutes. This was the routine part of tonight\u0027s job that he always struggled to do. It wasn\u0027t that it was dreadful as such, is was just so damn unrewarding, in the immediate sense. Most of us have gotten so used to responsive websites and immediate gratification when we tap or click something on our device, that this type of use of electronics can\u0027t help but feel... well, unrewarding. \r\nFirst, he had to boot up the Tails USB he had received when he was \u0027offered\u0027 entrance into the Banshee Bulletin Board. Then he had to make sure the Tails installation was up-to-date to avoid intruders during his session on the board. He had on more than a couple of occasions ordered substances through dark web markets, and over time he had taken a somewhat lax approach to the security part of the operation; even if the authorities were able to somehow intercept his doings, they\u0027d still have to prove it, and he had always figured that nailing some sad sap\u0027s drugs substances that were clearly for personal use... well of course, during the last part of that part of his life, his orders may have been large enough to be charged as \u0027for distribution\u0027 even if they were for personal use... but still: why would the authorities bother with making the case, when you had people ordering coke from their personal Facebook accounts? What type of composition of mind would be required to see the straight path and the path that involved going through various layers of encryption and probably own up to the fact that some kind of international privacy law had been broken along the way, and decide that the latter sounded most intriguing. Not a very typical one he had always supposed.\r\nBut things were different here, or well... the stakes were higher. Which he knew all too well. So he kept up to date on the latest security recommendations and kept his setup up to date.\r\nAnd then came the whole logging-in process. He had to go to the main site to initiate the sign-in, then go to another site, input the ID\u0027s of his latest 3 assignments, and finish the verification process. \r\nAll in all, the procedure called for alertness he was finding it harder and harder to raise because failure to sign in and complete a job at least once every 3 months meant that your user would be set to \u0027Banned\u0027 and as he knew all too well, the distance from \u0027Banned\u0027 to \u0027Terminated\u0027 could be as little as a couple of hours. \r\n",

      "Text": "And then a strange thing happens: the young man\u0027s mind goes blank, which is probably a pretty good summary of the thoughts that had run through his mind for the past 10 minutes: he is lost and has no idea where to go.\r\nAnd then, as he had done on so many occasions before when he felt lost, he continues in the direction he is already going, gets started on the damn update-check (all up-to-date), completes the unrewarding task of signing in and gets to the part where he marks the job as \u0027Completed\u0027, and then he has to provide \u0027Proof of Execution\u0027: something that only the person who carried out the job would know; information that couldn\u0027t have been obtained by hearing about the job or having been at the scene and once again curses himself: this is another part of his routine that he has gotten sloppy about. For the first 5 jobs he did, he had actually left something for the investigators in or under the body. Then there had been a period of delivering an in-depth crime scene report. That was probably his most \u0027professional\u0027 period. Now, he usually resorts to just describing what had gone down, and hoping the coroner\u0027s report would be consistent with what he put in. \r\nSo, what had gone down tonight? Pedersen - man 32 - had parked his car in the parking lot of the social housing area where he lived. The young man had been waiting in the stairway on the landing above the door to Pedersen\u0027s apartment and attacked him with the crowbar as he opened his entrance door. Had it been 5 or 6 blows to the side of Pedersen\u0027s head with the crowbar? He puts in 5 to be on the safe side, and then thinks that there isn\u0027t really a safe side, and knowing himself, it was probably more likely 6. He corrects it to 8. And then he had used the sharp end of the crowbar... and had made a mess... but at least it did leave some details around the entrance that should suffice as \u0027Proof of Execution\u0027 and the young man submits the information to close the job.\r\nNow, the young man does something that sets him apart from a large portion of the human population. Feeling tired and burnt out from their main occupation - and this had been the young man\u0027s main occupation for more than a year now - having money to get through life for at least 6 months and 3 months until he had to mark the next job as completed, most people would probably have thought along the lines of: \u0027well, that was a nights work well done\u0027 turned off the computer and found some activity they might find rewarding or relaxing. Get their mind off their work, so to speak. But that\u0027s not what the young man does, and if you had asked him why, or if he had thought to ask himself why, he very likely would have had a hard time coming up with a sensible answer. \u0027Because that\u0027s what I do\u0027. And thus, he went on the site\u0027s forum, which was primarily used by the users of the site to exchange information on jobs they were considering (with a lot of paranoid smoke screening and misleading information guaranteed) or to obtain information that would help them submit a job. The jobs themselves were posted on the main bulletin board, but it paid off to keep up-to-date with the forum since it usually contained information about the jobs that wasn\u0027t available on the job descriptions themselves. And it was here, that the young man came across a post that made his heart stop for a second. The title reads: \r\n\r\n\u0027Lake-girl seeks 23928-hero to track down Shadow-Man\u0027\r\n\r\nIt\u0027s a title that would probably be filtered out from the contact ad part of any respectable newspaper as pure nonsense, but it doesn\u0027t stand out on the forum of the Banshee Bulletin, where users use all kinds of in-the-know slang and abbreviations to get their point across. The reason it stands out to the young man is partly due to the number 23928... The ID of a job he had recently completed. But combined with the use of \u0027Lake-girl\u0027, which has a very personal meaning to him - and not one he believes he has ever told anyone about - it feels like a personal message directed at him. \u0027And why does \u0027Shadow-Man\u0027 ring a bell?\u0027 He clicks the post to see the details:\r\n\r\n\u0027I saw you John, but you didn\u0027t see me. If you had gone on for one more stop, we could have gone together.\r\nPlease do the interview with Frank ETD \u002B 42d 5h, and please do good. I\u0027ll find you.\r\nI miss you John\u0027\r\n\r\nHe absolutely knows that this is for him, and it doesn\u0027t take him long to look up when job 23928 had been, and arrive at the conclusion that wherever \u0027Lake-girl\u0027 wants him to be, she wants him to be there at 14:30 on Tuesday, which gives him more than enough time to figure out the other details.\r\n",
