      "Text": "John is walking to the train station on a bright Summer morning and he is on time. When he closes in on the train station, he sees his old Elementary School teacher Miss Jansen, looks to his own wrist and sets off sprinting for the train. John is running on fumes when he reaches the platform of the station, just in time to see his train setting off. He pulls hard on the throttle of his own energy supply in a last-ditch attempt to catch the train, but for all his intent and resolve, he only catches a glimpse through the windows of someone who looks a little like the dead woman from work... Angela... before the train has accelerated out of reach.\r\n",
