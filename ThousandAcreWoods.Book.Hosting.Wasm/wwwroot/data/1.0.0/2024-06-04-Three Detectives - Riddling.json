It was no more than 5 hours ago, that this little band of amateur detectives assembled in Sune\u0027s office in the basement for their first meeting, and John practically had to drag Albert along by the boots. The guy was shaking so hard walking down the stairs as long-since repressed memories of some sick prank came topside in the ocean of Albert\u0027s mind. And then look at the \u0027murderous-little-bastard\u0027-to-be now!\r\nJohn can feel this place getting under his own skin as well. The worst part about it is that the madness gets into your head, and somehow you stop noticing that it\u0027s there while the disease slowly eats away at your sanity. John \r\nremembers having read about a parasitic creature that will infect bees and wasps and take control of their mind, and while the creature is spawning offspring that nest inside the animal\u0027s body, the animal falls more and more under control of the parasite until it\u0027s time for the offspring to hatch and the parasite pushes the big red self-destruct button causing the animal to kill itself and leave its remains for the offspring to feast on. \r\n",

Of course, if she offered to go somewhere more private with one of them so he could have a closer look, he may feel forced to oblige in much the same way that John wouldn\u0027t mind catching Frank doing some weird shit that would justify pummeling the man silly, but neither had any intent. But now that it is out there, John inevitably gets to thinking about some more aspects of the situation: there is definitely something about Frank that rubs him very wrong, but he is also suddenly struck by an all-new realization - though come to think about, the old freak might have hinted at it a couple of times: say he was right about Frank and this little unholy group of outcasts killed the man and were able to get away with it and prove to the world that Frank had been responsible for every catastrophe since the destruction of Babel, his job here at FinaLibre would be done. And how would he feel about that? UNSATISFIED!\r\nThe old bastard is right: \u0027his involvement in this scene is about a lot more than figuring out who killed Angela and prevent further killings.

The first couple of years were sort of a struggle just to stay alive, but around 7 years ago we had managed to secure a solid foundation in terms of loyal clients and we slowly began hiring more people. Almost 6 years ago, one of those people was named Frank. \r\nHe had taken the long road before ending up with us: after high school, he first served his mandatory conscription and then joined the Special Forces and did 2 tours to Afghanistan. He then did some kind of voluntary work related to the conflicts in Syria and Iraq around the year of 2015, but he has always been very reluctant to talk about that... don\u0027t get me wrong: I\u0027m sure he was on the \u0027right side\u0027 - if ever there is a such in war - but I\u0027ve always gotten the feeling that he experienced some pretty gruesome stuff down there, and I haven\u0027t pushed the issue."

He is by no means the brightest or most knowing here at the company, but when he sets his mind to something, he goes for it full-throttle! And he believed in our mission... You see, most of the people we hire - especially those bringing a degree in Finance or Economics - come with a mindset of \u0027what will you give me, if I give you this\u0027, but Frank really believed in our purpose: to make the capital markets accessible to everyone and always gave his all."

          "Text": "3 years ago I had a conflict with him and since then... our relationship has gone... cold, I suppose. Frank hired a guy he had served with in Afghanistan who - like himself - had gone on to study Finance and seek work in the Financial Sector. The guy had lost one of his legs from a roadside bomb, and I always figured Frank somehow wanted to make up for the guy\u0027s loss, but Frank\u0027s relation to him blinded him from seeing the guy for what he was: lazy and manipulative. I was going to have a talk to Frank about it when my wife - who is CFO for another financial institution - told me that the guy had approached her company and offered to sell confidential secrets from one of our RnD initiatives, so I just fired the guy the first chance I got. I was still going to have a word with Frank about the issue... but then I decided not to. The thing is, that Frank was beginning to show signs of fatigue, but this thing sort of brought new life to him. 3 years ago, Frank\u0027s wife was pregnant with their first son, and between them settling down in a house and getting ready for a baby and Frank\u0027s responsibilities here at the company, I think it was all getting to be a bit much for him. But then when this thing happened... there was no doubt he was angry with me for firing his friend, and with good cause... neither he nor anybody else knew about the guy offering to sell trade secrets to the competitor... but Frank seemed able to harvest that anger and put it into his work. In many ways, he became the best version of Frank we\u0027ve had! And that made me figure that if seeing me as an unreasonable asshole could help Frank - and by extension the company - be more efficient, then I didn\u0027t mind being the bad guy. For the past many years, I have expected Frank to succeed me when the time is right, and he has a much better handle on what goes on around here than I ever did, so I\u0027m mostly just waiting for Frank\u0027s private life to settle down a bit - they had their 2nd son last year - before seizing the opportunity to get out and see what else life has to offer."
