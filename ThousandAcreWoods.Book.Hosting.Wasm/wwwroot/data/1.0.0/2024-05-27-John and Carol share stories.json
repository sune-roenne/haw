In terms of everyday tangibles for one: my mother had worked part-time, so my father could put in more hours at work, and now he was left alone in charge of raising me while also having to make ends meet. It was a good thing my mother had been financially responsible enough to insist on life insurances for both of them, since it allowed us to keep the house and let my dad work less, so he could dedicate himself to what he now considered his only important responsibility: making sure I got through to adulthood. I guess I\u0027m the only person that can really evaluate his performance, and it may be said that he was competing in a field for which he didn\u0027t have much natural talent, but in terms of effort he broke the scale!"

For the first couple of years, the state of affairs of my social life was kinda bleak: I seldom played with the other kids neither IN school nor AFTER school, but they also pretty much left me alone. That changed sometime during 3rd grade, where the social atmosphere of the classroom turned sour; hard to say why, but a gang of 4 shitty kids was at the center of it and it didn\u0027t take them long to single me out as the weakest of the herd."

I don\u0027t know if they stopped out of their own volition or if maybe someone happened to walk by, but when I came to they were running away and were already some 100 meters away. I felt guilty as I was walking the rest of the way home, determined not to let my father know, feeling like I should have been able to win that fight. But, of course I couldn\u0027t... keep it from him; he took one look at me and asked me what the hell had happened, and I just broke down, and he picked me up and held me and I cried and tried to tell him about it but couldn\u0027t because I cried so hard and he comforted me and I cried until at some point I was done."

And then he did what I doubt many fathers have done: he showed me just what he meant by that.\r\n \r\nHe helped me analyze the situation. We drew diagrams of the 4 boys, who their friends were, and what we knew about their families and plotted out different strategies for handling the situation. Some of the suggestions were the usual \u0027have a talk with the parents\u0027, \u0027talk to the school\u0027 and that type of thing, but we also visited some more extreme suggestions. Things like: if I threatened this kid with a knife and my father bashed in the brains of that parent, what is the likelihood of the police or the child protective services getting involved? I guess it\u0027s the sort of thing a parent may indulge a child in for them to \u0027get it out of their system\u0027 but I\u0027m pretty sure he was 100% serious. I think he would have killed himself when my mother died, had it not been for him feeling obliged to stick around to raise me, and on that day, he seemed as much at a loss as to how to handle the situation as I was."

My father had a heavy bag that he would go a couple of rounds on every evening, and he had often asked if would join him, which I had always declined. During that Summer I put in at least 2 hours a day, either on the bag or in one-on-one drills with him. How much of his teachings had a genuine source in a recognized martial arts lineage and how much he just came up with on the spot I have often wondered, but I never asked him about it. As I got ready for my first day back at school, I felt really good about my chances of beating those 4 punks, even if I ended up having to take them on all at once, but as it turned out things played out very peacefully. I\u0027d go so far as to say: anti-climatic. The parents of the worst of the 4 punks had split up during Summer vacation, and both had moved out of town and this was apparently enough to completely change the dynamics of not only the group of the remaining 3 punks but pretty much our entire class. A couple of weeks into the new school year, I got what was probably a very questionable excuse at best for starting a fight with one of the remaining punks during recess, and I really let him have it! I know for a fact that I knocked out 3 of his teeth as I threw punches, elbows, knees, and kicks to his head, and I am honestly not sure I would have stopped short of killing him, had I not been dragged away by the two teachers on patrol during recess. In the end, the whole ordeal got me 2 weeks of suspension, a daily habit of working out, absolute confirmation of the length of my father\u0027s support, and most importantly: a whole new outlook on the world. Before that talk with him, I saw the world as something being run mainly by adults, just tugging me along. I now understood that I was an operator and that I could set a course for my own ship. It may be that my vessel was small and moved at a slow pace, but I could set a course and propel myself along the course."

What\u0027s worse is, that people have gotten used to this, and instinctively know what information to filter out as paid advertisement. What we really wanted, was for these so-called oracles to broadcast to the world just how great a product we had but on their own accord. And so this is the strategy she set about implementing. She had gotten a hold of a lot of raw data on how different people were connected through Facebook, LinkedIn and Reddit, and to what extent they interacted with each other\u0027s posts, and based on this, she was able to construct a super elaborate graph of interrelations in the target demographic. She analyzed the data for interesting vertices on the graph, and in doing so pinpointed 15 regular Joe Schmoes, whose impact on the oracles of the community she conjectured would be enough to sway them in our favor. Normal, everyday people, working everyday jobs and leading everyday lives hoping to retire maybe 10 years ahead of time. People you wouldn\u0027t recognize if you saw them on the street, but who would spend 2 hours in dedication to \u0027the cause\u0027 every day, either analyzing on their own behalf or sharing content in closed social network groups. She took a week off from her job and went to work on these 15 people, visiting each and everyone; sometimes under the guise of being a fellow aficionado, sometimes just \u0027happening to bump into them\u0027. And she made herself liked! And more importantly, she got them sold on just how amazing a product portfolio we have here at FinaLibre. On a few occasions, the targets expressed that they found our platform lacking in terms of integration, and she would reply along the lines of: \u0027Oh Gosh! Aren\u0027t you just right... and such a darn shame, because I like everything else about them. You know what, let\u0027s write them an email\u0027 and then she or the target would write an email to a fictional guy at FinaLibre, who would then reply within the time it took for her to get onto the FinaLibre VPN, something like \u0027Good Golly! That\u0027s a great idea. We\u0027ll have it in production within the week\u0027, and you know what? She did have it in production within the week, either by doing the feature request herself and then convincing the relevant Product Owner to approve it for deployment, or just straight-up convincing the relevant team to implement and release the feature."

In just 3 days, every major influencer within the community was talking up FinaLibre with phrases like: \u0027EVERYBODY IN THE COMMUNITY KNOWS ABOUT THIS COMPANY, BUT IN CASE YOU\u0027VE BEEN OUT OF THE COUNTRY...\u0027. 15 people is what constitutes \u0027EVERYBODY\u0027. Our costumer-commitment and AUM grew by a factor of 3 within 10 days, a growth we have never come close to neither before nor after. And the atmosphere at the office was electric! We were blowing up! And of course everybody wanted to know who or what was behind this sudden interest in our product, and management held assemblies where they told anyone in possession of knowledge of how this had come about to step forward and be rewarded, and when nobody stepped forward no matter how insistently management asked them to, everybody just assumed that it probably was just a really lucky strike, and that Lady Fortuna was just rewarding us for having a really great product."

And so he approached her, and congratulated her on a job well done, and told her that he had this 1 million EUR pot of money that he would basically reward her with. And she declined. And she kept declining and insisted that she be paid for the overtime she had put in and be refunded her vacation-days and the money she had spent on transportation, but that she did not under any circumstances want to receive any other payment for her work on the campaign, and eventually Donnie relented to her demand, and so she received a total of 7.600 EUR for the campaign.
