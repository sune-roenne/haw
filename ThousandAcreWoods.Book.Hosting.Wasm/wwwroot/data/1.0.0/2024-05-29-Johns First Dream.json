      "Text": "John is jogging towards the train station, cursing his poor time management skills. He has a feeling like he had been on time right up until it was time to actually leave the apartment, and then something had happened, and now he is running late. John believes that he can still make his train if only he runs the rest of the way. It\u0027s still pretty chilly for a Summer morning, but he may have to take a shower and change when he gets into the office, but it beats having to wait 20 minutes for the next train to Thousand Acre Forest. \r\nJohn doesn\u0027t immediately recognize the old lady when he runs by her, but when she calls out his name, he knows that there is no getting around it. He\u0027s going to have to be polite, and stop and have a talk with her. He owes Miss Jansen that much.\r\n",

John had grown up without a mother, step-mother or even a \u0027Father\u0027s regular call girl\u0027 in his life, but the closest thing he had had to a mother figure in his life growing up, was Miss Jansen. \r\n",
