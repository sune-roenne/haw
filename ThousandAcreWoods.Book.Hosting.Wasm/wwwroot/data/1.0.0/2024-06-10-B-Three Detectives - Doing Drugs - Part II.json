      "Text": "Google search trends tell us, that the term \u0027Quantum\u0027 saw a major rise in popularity around November of 2008 and has since then maintained a popularity about a fifth of what it was at its highpoint during that final inning of 2008.\r\nI would go so far as to venture, that unless you work in very specific branches of physics or quantum computing, or was involved in the production of the Ant-Man installments of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, you have a fairly neutral relationship with the concept of quantum. It can therefore be hard to understand how the sentence \u0027Quantum-Man reclaims\u0027 has such a dramatic impact on the young man who has gone to the bathroom to relieve himself, that it sends him running out of the men\u0027s room with his trousers and underwear still around his ankles, but I suppose it is the result of a very enthusiastic enactment by the man in the air ducts - now identifying as \u0027Quantum-Man - combined with a very unlucky set of circumstances and/or pre-existing conditions with the young man. \r\nHad it for instance not been for the suspenseful build-up of tension to the scene as Quantum-Man observes his mark through the air vents and \u0027de-fumigates evil\u0027 in an almost inaudible moan, it is unlikely that the scene would have played out like it does. Had it not been for the uneasy feeling of being watched, looking around the room, thinking he sees what looks like glowing cat eyes through the air vent, dismissing it as the workings of a stressed-out mind, thinking \u0027there WAS something there\u0027 and looking back at the vent to now very clearly see a set of red eyes encased in a bloody and sweaty face - drool running in a steady stream out of one corner of the mouth only milliseconds before the face erupts in an explosion of: \u0027QUANTUM-MAN RECLAIMS\u0027 and then on this, the first day of easing off benzodiazepines prescribed to him after a stressful event in the company\u0027s basement involving organ harvesters, Cecil certainly wouldn\u0027t have reacted the way he did. But such are the conditions and such goes Cecil storming out of the building for the second time in as many months, naked from the waist down except for the trousers that make his evacuation all the more troublesome. And Quantum-Man goes on with his evil ways.\r\n\r\n",

      "Text": "On a chilly Autumn day by the lake of his mind, free from space and time, offset along the V-axis, John has his own things to worry about, most notably the young girl standing knee-deep on the other side of the lake, calling for John to join her. This is another one of those scenes that would have most people saying \u0027Yeah?! What\u0027s so bad about that? You should have seen some of the things I have...\u0027 and continue on in that annoying fashion, and once again we need to know a little background to appreciate the intensity of the situation as experienced by John. The thing is, that John had experienced this specific scene in dreams on various occasions throughout his childhood, never with a happy ending. If John tried to escape the scene by running away, a mysterious force would pull him back. If he ignored the girl on the other side of the lake, her insisting that he join her would get louder and more intense, until the entire world would resonate with her deafening shrill shriek. And lastly, if he would venture down into the water and across the lake, which he had done only once, the water would turn to thick blood, the girl would come charging at him, throw her arms around him, and pull him down into the bloody swamp with her. In either scenario, he would feel almost frozen by fear, unable to act. Throw in the fact that every previous re-play of this scene had at least been in the setting of a warm summer day and that the setting now has a very cold Autumn wind blowing directly at his face, John\u0027s aversion to coming here makes a little more sense.\r\n\r\nJohn stares across the lake to the girl on the other side. It\u0027s the same girl. Always the same girl. Pretty in her own right, maybe 17. Around that age. She never changed, even as he got older. He doesn\u0027t remember having known anyone who looked like that throughout the course of his life. As usual, her face is locked tight in a weird grimace halfway between a grin and a scream of agony, and although he can\u0027t see her eyes from here, he absolutely knows what they will look like... those swirling irises... actually spinning hypnotically around in the middle of her eyes. \u0027No rest for the wicked\u0027, \u0027pursue your destiny John\u0027. John starts walking through the water towards the girl who, as expected, starts running towards him. As she comes closer, John stares into her eyes, and not long before reaching his limit, that point where you have pushed yourself so far beyond the boundaries of what you think you can endure that you accept whatever devil that may take you, he hears... no, not quite hears, but not quite sees either... experiences the... \u0027essence\u0027 may come closest, of Angela. \u0027Come home John, let go\u0027. And John lets go as the girl in the lake tackles him and pulls him with her into the now seemingly bottomless pool of blood. And for a short moment, John\u0027s consciousness let\u0027s go in much the same way as when you lay down to take a 15-minute power nap and you get up just before the alarm would have prevented you from actually falling asleep: you haven\u0027t slept but somehow both you and the world have changed in those 15 minutes. When John\u0027s mind gets up from his power nap, he is deep underwater... or: \u0027underblood\u0027 maybe?... Alone in what feels like an endless ocean. But at least the cold is gone... in fact, the gooey substance now feels almost boiling hot, as if he is swimming along the underwater magma outlets where two tectonic plates meet. And as he only notices after a good long period of time swimming around down here: breathing doesn\u0027t seem like something he needs to concern himself with. In fact, the only thing he really feels is an immense feeling of loneliness. No matter in what direction he looks, there is just an endless amount of emptiness. In a sense, this is what he had always expected to find when experimenting with psychedelics, and he always attributed that expectation to a weird cartoon produced in the 1970s or 80s, but this is the first time he has come anywhere close to psychedelic underwater tomfoolery. John has an intuition that if he gives into the small voice in the back of his head, telling him that he is going to die alone down here swimming aimlessly around in the vast void, he is going to panic and have a really bad time. John closes his \u0027inner eyes\u0027 and tries to lower his agitation level, and is at the brink of obtaining a sense of \u0027oneness\u0027 with the void when - from someplace very far away - he hears his father\u0027s sobbing voice. \u0027My boy! My sweet little boy\u0027. John feels like this is a little much to put on a person at the bottom of the Mariana Trench of an absurdly un-thought-through acid trip, and sets off swimming to escape the awful sobbing voice. And to his amazement, he discovers that he can swim really  fast, and zoom through the water like a missile through the sky.\r\n\r\nIt is while zooming through the void, that he notices a movement out of the corner of his eye, and playfully decide to follow it. He is a shark traveling effortlessly through the water... in pursuit. He is in the midst of passing the other shark when it suddenly latches on to him, sending them both spinning around in the void, as he looks straight into the electrified essence of Angela, her face looking absolutely charged to max-capacity with... MADNESS. And he knows he is too. Pure murderous madness. And they go round and round, daring the void to come at them, moving the endless masses of water along their circular path creating an underwater whirlwind that grows into a vortex that seems capable of draining the entire ocean until they finally fall prey to the forces of their own doing and are swept down the bathtub drain and John is thrown into the final chapter of his \u0027jump along the V-axis\u0027: the damp and humid castle corridors of his memory.  \r\n\r\n",

      "Text": "While John is in this way engaged in the humbling experience of seeing himself lost in the boundless void, the man previously known as Albert - now Quantum-Man, is continuing his acts of terror on the \u0027Upstairs Dwellings\u0027. The story of Quantum-Man - at least, as understood by Quantum-Man himself - is, that he had been quite an ordinary human being when a \u0027mind cloud\u0027 had killed his friend and made him choose between spending an eternity \u0027offset by 2 V-units\u0027 or channel the will of the \u0027mind cloud\u0027 into this world, and \u0027when you put it like that?\u0027 Quantum-Man had thought. To a lot of people, whether the thumping in the air ducts of the building as he \u0027flows inaudibly\u0027 about is caused by Albert or Quantum-Man is about the same difference; most of the other employees would have found it pretty weird had they known the truth, but many would have been relieved to know that it wasn\u0027t the damn \u0027Rat-problem of 2022\u0027 all over again. To Albert however, the division is huge, as it allows him to clear himself of the horrible actions committed by Quantum-Man. Albert for instance always thought of himself as a kind-hearted and humble soul; sure, he did sometimes dream of smashing the \u0027Alpha-pricks\u0027 from Client Management with a wooden baseball bat, but since getting to know John he has realized that this is after all the kiddy-pool of pent-up anger. Especially with women, Albert has always gone a long way to please and come off as friendly in a non-creepy manner and wouldn\u0027t dream of using his experience with the female body in all its shapes and sizes to anything but spreading well-being. Quantum-Man however, does not have any moral barrier or behavioral codex keeping him back; when the \u0027mind cloud\u0027 commands him to enact the will of the cloud, Quantum-Man obeys without thought or reason. And as it turns out, this combination of personalities can be a very dangerous thing! Not in the sense of thoughtlessly propping a mass murderer up on an unknown quantity and combination of hallucinogens and blindly turning your back to him while you try desperately to jump back along the V-axis, but in the sense that it holds potential for causing a lot of emotional pain.\r\n\r\nWhat Quantum-Man discovers is, that while the \u0027mad-screaming-maniac-behind-the-air vent\u0027-approach works wonders on guys as they are performing their afternoon-disembowelment-ritual, it tends to anger the women more than it makes them scared, yelling awful, hurtful things like \u0027get the fuck out of here you fucking freak\u0027 at him. However, the prostitute-previously-known-as-Albert, has a wealth of information to draw on in order to really get at the women in the bathroom. The thing about being a not-particularly-attractive-male-prostitute is, that most women don\u0027t really feel like they have to maintain any type of facade around you. Combined with the fact that they are paying him, means that more than a few of his clients have put menu items such as \u0027psychologist\u0027 and \u0027general physician\u0027 on the \u0027A la carte\u0027-part of Albert\u0027s menu, and would happily order from them in between the appetizer, main dish, and the dessert, telling him things like \u0027I worry so much about this chunk of fat on my tummy that I have started wearing a corset which is just horrible in combination with my flatulence\u0027, causing Albert to develop - without any conscious effort - the ability to not only have a really good idea of what the women he sees look like naked, but also which parts of their bodies they feel most insecure about. As Albert has seemingly vacated the premises, this ability now just lies there on the inside of Quantum-Man\u0027s skull, waiting to be used to do the mind cloud\u0027s evil bidding. With whispers so faint, that they surely must be coming from inside the target\u0027s own mind, Quantum-Man continues his reign of terror with remarks like: \u0027they ALL noticed\u0027 and \u0027this skirt totally doesn\u0027t hide them\u0027.  \r\n\r\n",

      "Text": "As Quantum-Man is expanding his evil reign of terror, Albert has gone AWOL and Sune sits trapped by the consequences of his refusal to acknowledge facts, John\u0027s situation is unusually dull. He sits, somewhat delusional, staring down a long extremely moist corridor, wondering what the hell the reason for bringing him here had been. He had been scared shitless as he stood in the lake of blood being charged by the freakish young woman, but in the same way as getting off the couch and hitting the gym is not something you really want to do but you do it anyway because it\u0027s good for you, confronting what had been a lifelong recurring nightmare had seemed like something that needed to be done at one time or another. And even though it wasn\u0027t something he could really name or pin a definition to, he had realized that the blood in that lake was inevitably tied to him. \r\n\r\nThat feeling of being alone in the void was something he knew all too well, and the maddening excitement of not being alone and playing with Angela was something that resonated off the happiest memories of his life. \r\nBut what in the world is THIS about? It\u0027s just a long brick corridor. The kind you\u0027d expect any rational 15th-century monarch to have built as a last-ditch underground escape route, for use when the peasants revolted against higher taxes, daily whippings or whatever the hell had them all so worked up when they came to exercise their God-given right to mob-led pitch-fork democracy. Except this corridor continues for as far as John can see, with no apparent doors or connecting corridors, but of course, John can\u0027t see that far because it is pitch-black everywhere except for the places where candles light up small circles on the wall and floor and these spots are stretched pretty thin along the apparently endless corridor, with large lengths of corridor in complete darkness. From the circles of light closest to him, he can see that at least those circles are covered with blood spatter, but that is about the extent of familiarity this place has to offer. \r\nIt would be wrong to say, that \u0027John had always been a man of action!\u0027, at least, he never really saw himself that way but the same would probably be said about a man of action. \u0027So alright, maybe I AM a man of action\u0027 John thinks and then feels like he gets it a little more right with \u0027I am not really a man of contemplation\u0027, and so far, contemplation was about all John could think of doing down here. His first instinct had of course been to grab a light, and start walking down the corridor, but it had been completely impossible to remove the two candles at the nearest circle of light, from the metal holders fixating them to the wall, and that first circle of light was about as far as he had gone, because that\u0027s when the drag became almost unbearable. The thing is, that as John had started walking down the hall, he noticed that his body felt heavier for each step he took, making each step a lot harder to take than the one before. The inverse had been the case when he had walked back to the place he had first entered the corridor and in which he was indeed now once again located.\r\n\r\nJohn gets to thinking back to that one time, when he and his team mates from football had discovered that the giant bench press rubber bands the heavy lifters used for working the top part of their bench press, could be used to shoot at other people. It took two people to operate them: one person had to push one side of the rubber band out in front and overhead of himself, while the other person would pull back and eventually release the rubber band, hopefully hitting it\u0027s intended target and not the backside of the other man\u0027s skull... Although, for the guy in charge of firing the rubber band, both outcomes had felt like sort of a success. John would like to have one of those rubber bands now. \u0027I wonder if the drag only affects a person\u0027s ability to move on his own accord, or if it would also slow me down if I could somehow shoot myself from a rubber band down the hall\u0027 John is thinking when he decides that he has had just about enough of this damn contemplative sitting-about and that - rubber band or no rubber band - it is time to DO something. God damn it, John can just sprint at full force down the corridor, and maybe he can outrun the drag. He decides to go for it now, before he has time to think about just how stupid that last notion had been. As it turns out, it ISN\u0027T possible to outrun the drag. Sure, John makes it about 3 meters further on this attempt, but now he is stuck in a mid-run, \u0027Heisman-trophy-as-it-would-have-looked-had-it-been-created-for-the-special-ed-league\u0027-pose completely unable to move neither forwards nor back.\r\n\u0027This is actually worse than sitting on the floor\u0027. \r\n\r\n",

      "Text": "If we were to play a game, in which I would ask you to name the arch-nemesis of a person of my choosing, and I were to say: \u0027Batman\u0027, I bet there\u0027s a good chance that you would think of \u0027The Joker\u0027. And if I were to say: \u0027The Joker\u0027, I bet that you would very likely say: \u0027Batman\u0027, assuming a parity in the selection of arch-nemesis, because after all: if you have selected someone to be your arch-nemesis, the least they can do is choose you back, because the fear of rejection and being the only person at the school dance without an arch-nemesis makes the pairing-option the most COMFORTABLE. But it isn\u0027t really the most RATIONAL, is it? If we approach the topic from another angle and try to de-clutter and de-mystify the effects of alienating nomenclature like \u0027villain\u0027, \u0027psychopath\u0027 and \u0027exhibiting-severe-anti-social-traits\u0027 or whatever else the psychiatrists subject us to for that prescription, people like \u0027The Joker\u0027 and Lex Luthor are really just assholes. And we know from experiences such as school- and workplace bullying that assholes will sometimes focus their energy on whoever they deem a sufficiently weak target regardless of whether or not that person is also an asshole or not. Most often though, assholes have a tendency to surround themselves with other assholes: they have asshole friends, asshole family, asshole colleagues, and they have asshole enemies. When looking at the situation in this light, it should come as no surprise that the arch-nemesis of Quantum-Man turns out to be - not a hero who arises in a time of need when employees were being harassed by an unseen - though not entirely UNHEARD - force of evil in the air ducts - but another asshole. An asshole, that Quantum-Man thinks of as \u0027The Shadow-Man\u0027.\r\n\r\nAlbert had always been a realist and had for instance never really believed in the notion of \u0027love at first sight\u0027, and Quantum-Man couldn\u0027t care one way or the other but from the moment he stares down at the dark figure standing in the shadows of the North 2nd-floor bathroom, he knows that he hates the person down there. The setting of this specific bathroom - where a young woman had been stabbed to death a little more than 2 weeks ago - may have added to the intensity Quantum-Man experiences in the room, but he would have hated that ill-lit figure in any setting. It may have happened during the aforementioned murder or it may have happened in the ruckus that followed, that the wall-lamp had been broken and nobody had found the time to fix it yet, leaving the small lamp above the hand wash mirror with the unfathomable task of lighting the entire room. Although it isn\u0027t something anyone ever says out loud, the shared belief among the staff at FinaLibre is, that it is useless to fix the broken lamp, because nobody is ever going to use that bathroom again (unless a disaster of unimaginable proportions is to occur in the cafeteria-kitchen and in that case, the poor lighting in the room may turn out to be a blessing). Indeed, since the clean-up crew had finished on the evening following Angela\u0027s murder, nobody has been in here. That is: nobody but the man who killed her, \u0027The Shadow-Man\u0027.\r\n\r\nWhen Quantum-Man first comes to the air vent of this bathroom, he believes the room to be empty, until he notices the shadow of something that can only be a person, standing still in a dark corner of the room. On top of Quantum-Man\u0027s ability to float soundlessly through any confined space, he also has the unusual ability to \u0027tune his sight\u0027, a move of the hands that to the untrained eye would look like someone wiping hair, sweat, and/or blood from his eyes. Tuning in on the man, he becomes able to sense the ghostly glare emitted from the area around the Shadow-Man that replays Angela\u0027s murder for the man\u0027s enjoyment over and over. Well, actually determining that THAT is what he is sensing is of course a little difficult, since Quantum-Man had been blessed with the good fortune of \u0027radical disco-lights\u0027 from the moment of his inception, but if that same spiritual birth had taught him anything, it is that it is perfectly alright to use a little imagination to fill out the dark corners of ignorance. \r\n\r\nKnowing what we know about Albert\u0027s build, it\u0027s hard to imagine that the Shadow-Man didn\u0027t hear Albert moving in on his current position from a long way away, but for a long time, the dark figure just stands there reveling in the beauty of his past misdeed even as Quantum-Man starts to growl at the dark figure. And then all of a sudden the figure raises his gaze to the air vent, and rays of red-hot microwave light are bombarding Quantum-Man, and the disco lights all shift to blood red, pounding to the beat of Quantum-Man\u0027s cold heart as he realizes that the Shadow-Man means to cook him like oatmeal pudding in a microwave oven and he lets out a primal scream supposed to be the declaration that \u0027this shitta is Quantum!\u0027 but instead comes out sounding like a hoarse mix between the scream of an angry drunkard before he launches himself into a bar brawl and a person being roasted alive. And then Quantum-Man decides on a tactical retreat, zooming through the air ducts of the building, back for reinforcements and back to receive new orders from the mind cloud.\r\n\r\nFrank hadn\u0027t really been expecting anyone to be watching him in the bathroom, and to say that Frank knows exactly what had just happened simply wouldn\u0027t be true, but Frank has a pretty good idea of who the fat weirdo in the ventilation system is and he knows how to deal with the situation. After all, he had hired the miserable fuck so naturally it was his job to terminate him. Like everything else around here.\r\nFrank looks at himself in the mirror, adjusts his tie, and calmly walks out of the bathroom. \r\n\r\n",

      "Text": "Sometimes, you have to stand your ground and fight, whether it be a social, symbolic or knuckles-against-bones fight. There are people who will push you as far as possible up into a corner until your only way out of the situation is through them. There are situations where the pillars of the figurative house you call your life are rattled and shaken, and you need to stop running around picking up framed memorabilia and get working on fortifying your home. John didn\u0027t do much with living by predefined principles or rules, but he did have a lot of ingrained behavior and reinforced habits. If for instance, you put two buttons in front of him - one of them labeled \u0027violence\u0027 - you could be pretty sure that he had pressed whatever button was stained with blood before you had the chance to present him with his options. As such, he finds his current situation, being completely frozen in space, very uncomfortable. As his movement stopped, his body never let go of the tension of running at max-intensity, and it took for the large muscles on the back of his leg to go into spasms, for him to realize that his situation would be much improved if he just lets go. \u0027Relax, and let go\u0027. And so he does, and though he wouldn\u0027t wish to be left like this for days, he is pretty sure he\u0027ll be alright like this until his kidney and liver have processed enough of the insane mixture he consumed, for his brain to start working on an exit-strategy back to reality. As such, John once again finds himself on the brink of coming to peace with himself and his current surroundings, when the damn sobbing returns. It is coming from somewhere very far off, but when you are standing completely still in an unventilated endless hallway, it doesn\u0027t take a lot of any sound for it to get under your skin. Luckily for John\u0027s sanity, he now hears something else: footsteps coming from down the hall. As they get closer, Angela appears at the edge of the darkness of the unlit area in front of him and walks up to him until she is only half a meter away from him, tilts her head to one side, and looks at him in much the same way a mother would look at a toddler who had just painted it\u0027s own face with peanut butter and says: \u0027John... You\u0027re going the wrong way\u0027, and as she says it, he realizes that not only is she right, but \u0027why had he not realized this before?\u0027 And with the realization, comes peace. Peace in the very real and physical sense that he regains the ability to move his body freely. Angela takes him by the hand and continues forward, and when they come to John\u0027s previous place of contemplation, the place where the lights stop and the road continue into complete darkness, John stops. Angela - now two steps in front of him - turns her head and looks at him as if to ask \u0027are you coming?\u0027 and he says to her: \u0027I\u0027ll be right behind you\u0027 and Angela walks on and after her 4th step, John can no longer see her out there in front. Keeping his inner eyes wide open, John walks into the darkness.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
