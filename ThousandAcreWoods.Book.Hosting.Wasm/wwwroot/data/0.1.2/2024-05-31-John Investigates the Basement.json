      "Text": "John suddenly feels the need to check the tattoo on his arm. \u0022AWAKE\u0022. But he already knew that.\r\nThere are dreams that are so real, that you feel really stupid when you wake up from them, because throughout the entire dream, you were convinced that you were in the real world.\r\nAnd there are situations in the real world, where the details of life sneak up on you in such a way, that you come to believe that you must be dreaming.\r\nThis is neither. John\u0027s not stupid. Granted, he has spent most of his life honing a very specific set of skills, which has led teachers at various institutions to conclude that \u0027the boy is hopeless\u0027, but that was a question of what you choose to dedicate your life to. And as a matter of fact, those skills come in handy in understanding the current situation. \r\nJohn noticed the CCTV camera following him in the stairway down to the basement, and he noticed the fact that this specific camera was different from every other surveillance camera in the building and that the wires from the camera ran down into the basement instead of up through the ceiling. John knows that the sense of unease he\u0027s feeling is caused by a very deep bass sound being projected from somewhere in the ceiling above him; if you know it\u0027s there, you can very faintly hear what sounds like a drowning engine every 6th second. John is also very aware, that the chanting he hears, is very likely a playback from a recording of something like Enya - though not one he remembers having heard before - lowered in pitch and played back at maybe 0.5 the regular tempo, he has even noticed that it repeats every 34th second. The flickering overhead lights are very good, but whoever is pulling the strings behind this scene, has apparently not considered that the chances of EVERY overhead light in the hallway struggling for death at the same time are minuscule. As for the woman yelling over the loudspeaker - and he is pretty sure that this sound - unlike the chanting - is coming from just a single speaker  - ... well...\r\n",

      "Text": "All in all, John understands most of what is going on, but it just doesn\u0027t make any God damned sense! It\u0027s like understanding every word of a sentence very clearly, but when you read the sentence out loud to yourself, it\u0027s pure nonsense. Like \u0022few mermaids obfuscate Gothic pencils\u0022. Pure nonsense! \r\nSomebody is clearly trying to get under his skin, but who would want to die so badly, that they would go through all this trouble?! There are so many easier ways to kill yourself than this. Is it because they want to lure John into recording him in the act? Again: if they wanted so badly to go, they could have just asked. \r\nHe has ruled out the dicks from Client Management; though he wouldn\u0027t put it past them to try for a practical joke, this is way too elaborate for any of them to have come up with. \r\n\r\nThe door leading into what appears to be a laundry room is open, and here, the suicidal joker has lit up black candles. Nice touch. The hooded figures standing around the bloody pentagram on the floor are also very nicely done, except for the fact that only 2 out of 5 are swaying, and the swaying seems just a touch too mechanical. Just to be sure, John does a quick sweep of the room and the robed mannequins. The room is clear. \r\nJohn continues down the hallway and now that shrill voice comes on again\r\n",

He is disappointed to realize that \u0027mother\u0027 is still holding on to the knife, because that means he has to restrain himself and keep the distance. \u0022But we can do that\u0022 John thinks as he charges the figure, causing the person to abandon his attempt to get up, and instead throw his head to the floor, away from John. \u0022Here comes the grunt work\u0022 John thinks, and begins working on the person\u0027s legs with his shin. John gets 7 good kicks in on the person\u0027s left leg, and unless the person has done A LOT of leg hardening, he\u0027s not going to be able to do much with that leg now. And then John sees the person draw the knife back for a throw, and John instinctively steps back and draws his arms up to protect his head, and then he hears the sound of the knife passing through the air - far enough away from John\u0027s ear for him to know that it certainly didn\u0027t hit him - but then the person starts with the fucking SCREAMING again, and then all the lights go out, and then the person kicks him in the nuts, and John knows that he has about 5 seconds before intense pain is going to reduce his mental capacity to that of Silvio Berlusconi in a Venice brothel on Easter Morning, and he can\u0027t see anything in this fucking darkness, and he wants so badly to kick something but chances are just too damn high that he is going to do more harm to himself than what he now considers his mortal enemy, and here comes the groin pain creeping up his stomach at first and then just blaring like a pain siren demanding the attention of every nerve ending in John\u0027s body. \u0022KEEP IT IN JOHN. Unless he\u0027s wearing night vision goggles, he\u0027s just as blind as you are. Take a deep breath, and slowly exhale... Oh God... here comes a bad one\u0022\r\n",

But more importantly: he want\u0027s to hear his movement. Oh yes, he is limping... It sounds like he has trouble standing on one of his legs. John taps the wall on his right side, and quickly throws himself against the wall on his left side, hoping his enemy didn\u0027t pick up on his movement. Nothing! John hears nothing! Not even breathing. John reaches with his hands in slowly expanding circles to determine whether the man is in his close perimeter, when the room suddenly goes from pitch black to blinding light, and John catches a faint glimpse of a person coming in for a tackle from about a meter and a half away, which is not enough for John to defend the attack. The man resumes his high-pitched screaming as he lands on top of John, and starts pummeling John with his forearms. The guy gets in a couple of good strikes before John regains composure, and gets in a couple of strikes of his own. Punch to the inside of the man\u0027s right shoulder, punch to the inside of the man\u0027s left shoulder.\r\n",

This was such a moment: not only was John able to see the scene from his own perspective, with the psycho laying on top of him frantically headbutting him, he could see the scene from the eyes of the psycho: John holding on around his neck, headbutting back in what both parties had by now realized was a futile war of will\u0027s to see who would first pass out from exhaustion and minor brain damage. Most notably though, John was able to see the scene through the eyes of Carol, who was now standing a few feet away, looking at this pathetic spectacle. \r\n",

John has all kinds of objections against what Sune wants him to do, but by now he is defenseless against the insanity floating around in this basement, the whole time gnawing at his mental defenses like maggots through a corpse, and decides to just go with it. And Sune is right: in a borderline psychotic way, John does actually have fun, and it does revitalize him. And when the kid runs screaming back towards the stairways he had come from less than 2 minutes prior, and John can hear the screams echo from above as the kid hurdles through the building, clearly taken to the floor by office furniture on a couple of occasions, and he hears the hysterical laughter of the old bastard rolling around in pig\u0027s blood on the floor next to him, John is no longer able to hold anything together and is seized by a fit of laughter that ultimately sends him to the floor clutching his aching stomach.\r\n",
