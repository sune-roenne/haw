      "Text": "\u0027What a night!\u0027 Thomas thinks as he begins regaining consciousness. Thomas knows that this is going to be a hard day to get through, but luckily he doesn\u0027t have any plans and just thinking about last night dulls the headache a little and brings a smile to his face. And hey, doesn\u0027t he still have half a baggy? ... Yes, he thinks so. If only he can conjure up the initiative to get out of bed, then lining up and getting started will come automatically. Maybe he can even get in a few glasses of gin before the headache can really get a hold of him, and hey: then this day might turn out above descent after all. It\u0027s all about standing up, but before that, he has to open his eyes. Hmmm, that\u0027s weird! He opens his eyes and it\u0027s still dark. And what the fuck?! Is he tied to the bed?! He can\u0027t move! Thomas starts pulling the restraints around his ankles and wrists when he hears a \u0027whoosh\u0027 and feels something hitting him hard in the ribs. He opens his mouth to let out a scream of pain and then feels something being jammed into his mouth. That might be a sock! A used sock! Thomas hears a weird robotic voice coming from somewhere to his right.\r\n",
