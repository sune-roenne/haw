Throughout, small stacks of unused office furniture is stored at either side of the hallway. When Cecil has gone 3 steps along the hallway, one of the overhead lights begins to flicker, and within 10 seconds, another light joins in the flickering, creating an eerie atmosphere. Cecil is not immediately troubled, and pulls on the handle of the first door on his right, to discover what appears to be a pretty crammed storage room for more office supply. As he steps back into the hallway and closes the door to the storage room, the two lights closest the entrance to the hallway, give out. Except for a dark corner at the other end of the hallway, it is still reasonably lit, and Cecil continues along. \r\nCecil passes another room with cleaning supplies and a washroom - or so at least the signs on the doors will have him think - and decides to take the signs at face value. As he takes one more step along the hall, all of the lights go out and he is left in complete darkness. \r\n\r\nThe human mind is such a funny thing, with all of its little weird ways: it\u0027s capable of deciphering hidden messages in chaotic images of seemingly random shapes and colors and can send us traversing across the ever-growing canyon of time between our Now and Christmas Eve when we were 7 years old by just a whiff of cinnamon, but present it with a single contradictory piece of information to the otherwise convincing story of who we are and what we are doing, and it is ready to tear itself to shreds in sheer panic. If for instance, Cecil\u0027s mind did not have this tendency to question reality by a mere change in lighting, it would have easily convinced itself that: \r\n\r\n",

What his mind has forgotten, Cecil\u0027s body reminds it of as it first crashes into what might be a desk, then loses its balance on impact with something that may be the same damn chair he hit going the other way, and as a result hereof, does a nose-dive against the floor. Pretty much every part of Cecil\u0027s body has a message for Cecil\u0027s brain, but the latter is in no mood to argue and merely insists that the body fulfills its duty, gets off the floor and goes back to that running bit it failed so horribly at just a moment ago. \r\nCecil is thus hurdling his body towards the exit into the stairway when he hears a loud shout:\r\n",

A mute and dumbstruck group of employees watches the young man continue his sprint through the building towards the main exit, trying to decipher the meaning of the poor guy\u0027s shouts, which make mention of \u0027harvesting\u0027 and \u0027bloody murderous bastards\u0027 but are otherwise utterly intelligible. \r\nOnly a single person does not seem at all surprised by the scene. He actually seems to be rather enjoying himself, as he takes out his cell phone to record the grand finale featuring the horror-stricken young man running across the parking lot outside the building, in some direction where he prays to God the organ harvesters won\u0027t find him.\r\n",
