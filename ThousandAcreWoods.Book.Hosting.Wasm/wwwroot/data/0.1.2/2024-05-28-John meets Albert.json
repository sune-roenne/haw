      "Text": "Albert gets up from his desk at the Investment Compliance unit of FinaLibre every day at exactly 16:12, clears his desk, walks to the wardrobe where he puts on his long coat and walks out of the main entrance between 16:23 and 16:25. He then walks through the eastern part of the Thousand Acre Woods towards the nearest train station where he boards the train at 16:45. Every day. Wind and rain!\r\nIt\u0027s not that this departure carries any specific significance to him... he would be just as happy catching the 17:05, 17:25, or 17:45 departure... hell, for all he cares, his day would be just as fine if he were to catch the 20:05 departure - except of course for the longer working hours this would imply - but he has a reputation to uphold, and THAT is important to him.\r\n\r\nThis day is exactly like any other, and Albert is strolling along the narrow part of the dark pine tree patch that precedes the much brighter and broader stretch just before the station, probably thinking about all the nice things that await him tonight - because Albert is a man that works to live, and not the other way around - when he suddenly feels an explosion of pain in the backside of his left leg. Albert hardly registers the pain before he finds himself on his hands and knees on the narrow gravel path. \r\n",
