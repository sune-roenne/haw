      "Text": "Leo started with FinaLibre in November of 2022, and after a less-than-impressive tour through the Academy, Leo joined the Transactions and Settlement Team in April of 2023. \r\nLeo didn\u0027t particularly mind this; by now he had come to terms with the fact that he was no shooting star in the Financial Sector. It\u0027s not that he ever had any reason to suspect he was, but when he signed with FinaLibre in 2022 he had hoped, that his time as a student assistant for one of the country\u0027s large Investment Banking Firms would let him shoot right into the C-level. \r\nSome might say, that Leo was extraordinarily unlucky to be subjected to a particularly cruel-spirited \u0027Rite of Passage\u0027 and as a result of this had to be forcibly freed from the ventilation system by the Fire Department. These same people would probably also claim that trying to play Angela for some quick project credit and ending up suggesting to the board that FinaLibre went early-market on Hentai-NFTs, was just dumb luck. But then again, the pull-yourself-up-by-the-bootstraps people would certainly insist that such minor incidents would be no hurdle for Leo to overcome, was he the Christ Incarnate of the capital markets.\r\nLeo for one, didn\u0027t really bother claiming one or the other anymore but had reconciled himself to the fact, that his chance of \u0027making it big\u0027 was to hang in at FinaLibre and pray to God it would someday land him an easy job in a normal firm based on his merits of having been there during the upswing. \r\n\r\nThe afternoons were hard on Leo. Leo enjoyed the finer things in life, and this included the buffet in the FinaLibre cafeteria. On this day, the cafeteria served schnitzel which was an absolute favorite of Leo\u0027s, and to no one\u0027s surprise, he had attacked the buffet with an intensity that would impress most people. Leo is the price for this exertion now, as all of the blood in his body is being mobilized to his stomach in the fight against an alarming buildup of pork grease that is clogging everything up down there. Given Leo\u0027s less-than-fit-for-fight state, it takes him a few moments to notice that a person has sat down on an office chair next to him and is now staring at him. As Leo raises his eyes to look at the stranger he has to restrain himself from jumping back in his seat in shock. The stranger is looking at him with a deadly intensity, that makes it almost seem like he is concentrating to make his pupils form daggers to send through Leo\u0027s skull. After maintaining eye contact for about 10 seconds, the stranger slowly looks down at his own hands, in order to divert Leo\u0027s attention to the small sheets of paper he is holding. As the stranger convinces himself that Leo has read each note, he shuffles the papers so the next becomes legible. The messages written on the pieces of paper, are as follows:\r\n\r\n",

For what feels like minutes but in fact is only 40 seconds, Leo waits nervously for him to show up, and then notices him coming onto the path Leo is on from a crossing path about 100m further into the forest. Leo runs to meet the stranger, who is now talking on the phone with someone.\r\n",
