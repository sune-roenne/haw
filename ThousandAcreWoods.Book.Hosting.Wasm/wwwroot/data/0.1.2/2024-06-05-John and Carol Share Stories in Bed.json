She was really good at partying... I hope she wouldn\u0027t mind me saying this, but during the course of a party, she could drink almost a bottle of normal-strength alcohol and still retain her cool composure and attitude. As I said, she was a freshman the same year that I was, but we didn\u0027t have any classes together, and up until about the end of freshman year, I had only ever \u0027seen her around\u0027. And then around the end of our freshman year, there was a house party at this dude we both knew, and it started off pretty slow with about 10 people sitting around a table drinking and shooting the shit... and then this one dude, out of nowhere asks me: \u0027Yo John... What happened with the shithead on that stairway?\u0027 I wasn\u0027t expecting it at that time, because there hadn\u0027t been any talk about the incident in months, but I think I came off alright as I looked at the guy deadpan and said: \u0027I don\u0027t know, friend... I had just started going down the stairs and then I felt someone push me in the back real hard\u0027 and once again, I didn\u0027t try for an Oscar or anything but just left it at that and everyone around the table accepted the explanation... or so at least it seemed to me, and someone took the mic and ran with it in some other direction... and naturally I thought that was that, but then maybe an hour later, Louisa gets up to go to the bathroom or whatever, and on her way there, she comes over to me, leans in and whispers in my ear: \u0027Are you aware that your left eye gives off a faint twitch when you lie?\u0027 and I turn my head to look at her and she just winks at me and takes off to the bathroom... or whatever..."

And so, when I went looking for the upstairs bathroom at one point, and I came across Louisa standing alone in the parents\u0027 bedroom, I found it appropriate to strike up a conversation that started something like: \u0027Do you actually like the band or do you just wear the t-shirts as a fashion statement?\u0027 to which she replied something along the lines of: \u0027They are OK, but I mainly wear the t-shirts because of that one song... You know... I\u0027m afraid of the dark...? That\u0027s why I\u0027m always out so much... Hoping to find someone to comfort me in the dark...\u0027 and I\u0027m not doing her justice here, because the way she said it... she delivered those lines with such a straight face...

I had to choose between the girlfriend-ring and the BFF-necklaces and I ordered the ring\u0027 and without skipping a beat she replies: \u0027So when do I get it?\u0027, and so I went out to find a girlfriend-ring for her the next day, which I had low-key been expecting I\u0027d have to from the moment those words went across my lips, and hopefully figure out what the hell a \u0027girlfriend-ring\u0027 is in the process"

I think I had been good at handling jealousy during our relationship... Especially during the last part, where I had started feeling more and more \u0027boxed-in\u0027 to a lifestyle I didn\u0027t understand, I would work off of the emotions that jealousy would bring when I suspected she was cheating on me... and for the record: I don\u0027t have any reason to suspect that she ever did, but I honestly don\u0027t care... Once again... It\u0027s only if you ever meet her...\r\nBut seeing her in the bar with him brought up that old feeling of anger and rage... that someone had something that I could never have... and I felt really alone... and that made me want to hurt her... and not in a physical sense... I\u0027ve never understood that in relationships... I wanted her to feel the loneliness that I was overcome by... and I knew I had absolutely no right to feel that way, and believe it or not, that actually mattered a lot to me..."

It felt like I was invading your privacy in some way... It felt a little too weird, so I took off without stopping by to say hello... do you mind if I call you tomorrow afternoon? I have an early day and I\u0027m really beat\u0027 and she might have almost bought it, but then again: maybe not, because I re-read it the next day, and the spelling had been kinda off and maybe a bit too many smiley faces, but she and her date were already sitting in a taxi on their way to my place in any case - which I doubt was what the guy had been hoping for - and she decided to ring the doorbell and by then, I was OD\u0027ing on my living room floor, and when I didn\u0027t answer she asked her date to kick down my door and from there it was the usual drill of first aid and calling 112..."
