      "Text": "It is 16:33, and Albert is nearing the narrow patch of pine trees in the Thousand Acre Woods, on his way to catch the 16:45 train. The assault he had endured last week on the same patch of gravel track hadn\u0027t dissuaded him from choosing the shorter of the two most popular paths between FinaLibre and the Thousand Acre Woods (East) stop, but it had taught him to pay attention and be on the lookout, but even if it hadn\u0027t, he couldn\u0027t have missed the young man - \u0022John\u0022 - who stood with his back against a tree, most likely waiting for him. For a brief moment, Albert experiences a shiver running down his spine but quickly convinces himself that this meeting won\u0027t be a replay of their previous encounter. On making eye contact with Albert, the young man jerks his head up in what is universally recognized as the \u0027What\u0027s up\u0027-gesture you shoot at friends, and starts walking towards Albert. Had he known what was about to happen, John might have put a little more thought into picking the right gesture for the occasion, since the assumed camaraderie the gesture expressed sends Albert into a fit of rage. When they are about 2 meters from each other, Albert draws his right leg back and releases it in what could easily have passed for a mid-tier semi-professional soccer goalie driving the ball far down center field on a kick-off. The top of Albert\u0027s foot makes contact with John\u0027s inner thigh about 30 centimeters above the knee as Albert drives the point home by yelling:\r\n",

It\u0027s hard to blame Albert for not paying much attention to where he should aim his kick when the procedure was demonstrated to him last week - he had after all had other things on his mind  - but if he had been given more time to prepare, hopefully, he would have realized that it is preferable to avoid hitting the hip of the target - unless you have really durable feet and ankles.\r\n",
